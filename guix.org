* Common Actions
** List (Explicitly) Installed Packages:
If you want to see what packages the current user has explicitly installed via ~guix install~, then ~guix package --list-installed~ will list those packages. This will not list the dependencies of those packages, because that would be literally /all/ the packages and that's often not useful information.
** Export Profile Packages:
If you want to generate a file that can be used to rebuild a profile's packages/environment, then ~guix package --export-manifest~ will export a Guile script to do so. The following is an example manifest file for my WSL Doom Emacs config, with notable comments at the top:
#+begin_src scheme
    ;; This "manifest" file can be passed to 'guix package -m' to reproduce
    ;; the content of your profile.  This is "symbolic": it only specifies
    ;; package names.  To reproduce the exact same profile, you also need to
    ;; capture the channels being used, as returned by "guix describe".
    ;; See the "Replicating Guix" section in the manual.
