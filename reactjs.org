* React Hooks
** General Rules
1. Functions must be pure (or at least functionally "pure").
2. Hooks must fire in the same order, every time.
3. Only call Hooks *at the top level* (in order to satisfy rule #2). Donâ€™t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
** ~useState()~
- State will be preserved between re-renders.
- Does *not merge* state values with the state setter! You need to merge on your own.
- The only argument is the initial state.
- Returns values in the order you initialized them, which is why the *order of execution must not change*.
** ~useEffect()~
** ~useRef()~
