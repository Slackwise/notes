* React Hooks
** General Rules
- Functions must be immutable (or at least functionally "immutable").
- Hooks must fire in the same order, every time. (Place them at the top of the function!)
** ~useState()~
- State will be preserved between re-renders.
- Does *not merge* state values with the state setter! You need to merge on your own.
- The only argument is the initial state.
- Returns values in the order you initialized them, which is why the *order of execution must not change*.
** ~useEffect()~
** ~useRef()~
